#Abstract Factory

Provides interface for creating families of components which are related or dependent objects without specifying concrete classes

#When to use

* When you want system to be independent  of how its products are created or composed
* You want to reveal only interfaces of components without implementations
* System can be configured with different families of products for example you write controls that can be rendered in different
template systems
* You need enforce family of objects to work together by their interfaces
